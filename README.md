# SRT Time Formatter to Txt
for Jiten.

This program is a Python script that uses tkinter to load an SRT subtitle file, processes the content, and generates a formatted output as a text file. The output file contains the start and stop times of each subtitle line with a specific format, as requested by the client, Jiten.

## Features

## Output Format 

The output text file will have the following format:

```

start=4.0s stop=9.0s speaker_SPEAKER_
start=9.0s stop=13.0s speaker_SPEAKER_
start=13.0s stop=19.0s speaker_SPEAKER_
start=19.0s stop=23.0s speaker_SPEAKER_
```
